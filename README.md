# ai-chatbot
This is a simple AI chatbot built using Python, LangChain, and Chainlit. The chatbot is powered by the GPT-2 model, which is exposed through the Hugging Face framework. Currently, the chatbot processes user queries without maintaining chat history, making it a stateless conversational agent. Future improvements include adding context management to enhance conversation flow and user experience.
