## AI Chatbot Project - Tech Stack Decisions

### Overview

This project is an AI chatbot leveraging the Phi-3-Mini-4K-Instruct model from Hugging Face. Below are the key reasons behind the selected technologies.


## Tech Stack

### 1. Backend: Python & LangChain
- I wanted to learn and explore how to use LangChain to leverage its features in AI-powered applications.
- It simplifies working with AI models by offering structured workflows for prompt management, memory, and chaining.
- It provides integrations with various LLM providers, such as Hugging Face, OpenAI, and more.
- Using LangChain in this project adds a valuable skill to my portfolio for future AI/ML-related opportunities.

### 2. Frontend: Chainlit
- Provides a ready-to-use chatbot interface with minimal coding effort.
- Integrates seamlessly with LangChain for rapid prototyping.
- A great way to explore and add a modern AI-focused frontend framework to my skillset.

### 3. AI Model: Phi-3-Mini-4K-Instruct via Hugging Face
- Convenience of Use: Easy access to a variety of AI models with simple API integration.
- Community Support: A large, active community offers extensive documentation and model contributions.
- Pre-built Pipelines and Abstractions: Hugging Face provides ready-to-use pipelines (transformers.pipeline) that abstract complex AI processes into a few lines of code. These abstractions simplify integration and reduce development effort.
- Cost-effectiveness:
Many models can be accessed and tested for free or with minimal costs, making it an affordable solution for AI development.


## Conclusion

The combination of LangChain, Chainlit, and Hugging Face was chosen to build this AI chatbot due to their ease of integration, developer-friendly features, and ability to quickly prototype and experiment with AI models. This project serves as both a learning opportunity and a demonstration of modern AI chatbot development.
